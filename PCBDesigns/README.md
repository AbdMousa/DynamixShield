# PCB Designs
These are the open source designs of the PCB for DynamixShield. These were built using DesignSpark PCB 7.1. If you want to modify the designs you will need the NRTDesignSparkLibraries repository as well. A link for it is provided below. This library contains all of the component descriptions and layouts for custom parts. Follow the installation procedure outlined in the readme.
