â€‹In this instructable I will show you how to quickly and easily build a 5-axis robot arm using commercial off-the-shelf components and control it using an Arduino with a DynamixShield. The DynamixShield is a new add-on for either the Arduino Due, Zero, or Mega that I am promoting for my kickstarter campaign. It is a really cool shield f that performs level shifting for the newer 3.3 volt Arduino systems. It has numerous, modular Grove connectors to allow you to quickly plug-in different grove sensors and motors. It also has standard three-pin connectors for analog, digitial, and pulse width modulation signals, making it easy to use with standard servos. Best of all though, is that it has a built in controller for Dynamixel smart servos. This allows you to control Dynamixel AX, MX, and XL servos directly from the shield. When you combine this with the grove modules, it becomes easy to build complicated robots with just 3 or 4 connections. 

In this instructable I will use the DynamixShield to control a robot arm made from Bioloid frame components and Dynamixel AX-12 motors. It will have a pressure sensor on its claw to detect when it has fully gripped something. The arm will be controlled using two joystick grove modules. So it will take a total of four connections to the DynamixShield for this entire robot. Lets get started! Below is a list of the parts that you will need. I have included links to where I purchased them as well.
